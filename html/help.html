<h3>Overview</h3>

<ol>
	<li>As a gamification system to push the entire ~21 NUS students currently enrolled in Steven's CS3233 module to work as hard as they can...</li>
	<li>As a testing platform for Steven to self-learn Laravel framework, to be subsequently taught to Steven's CS3226 students :)</li>

</ol>
<p>Occasionally, we may open problem D (or even E) which is (are) the easier form of problem A/B/C. We give bonus 0.5% for top 3 in each mini contest. We use strict binary grading (Accepted or not Accepted: Wrong Answer, Time Limit, Memory Limit, Runtime Error, etc) for our contests.</p>

	<p class="problemB">
	Solve problem B of last week's mini contest at home, on your own pace, by next Wed 04.30pm (closed by the time Wei Liang's consultation hour is over), if you fail to solve it during the live Mini Contest. Simply submit your code to Mooshak, TA will check your last submission @ Mooshak.
