<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of this ranklist app is twofold: </p>
<ol>
	<li>As a gamification system to push the entire ~21 NUS students currently enrolled in Steven's CS3233 module to work as hard as they can...</li>
	<li>As a testing platform for Steven to self-learn Laravel framework, to be subsequently taught to Steven's CS3226 students :)</li>
</ol>

<div class="miniContest">
<h3>MC = Weekly Mini Contest (36%)</h3>
<p>9 Weekly Mini Contests, three problems in 75 minutes, using
<a href="http://algorithmics.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mooshak/cgi-bin/execute/9042797581778279" target="_blank">Mooshak.</a>
</p>
<p>(9 weeks x (3%+0.5%+0.5%)/week = 36%).</p>
<ol>
	<li>very easy/easy/warm-up/1-2 simple CP technique(s): 1%.</li>
	<li>medium/last week material, 2%.</li>
	<li>usually very hard and from topics not specifically taught in class, for CS3233R students, bonus 0.5% for CS3233/R students who can get this AC in contest time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Occasionally, we may open problem D (or even E) which is (are) the easier form of problem A/B/C. We give bonus 0.5% for top 3 in each mini contest. We use strict binary grading (Accepted or not Accepted: Wrong Answer, Time Limit, Memory Limit, Runtime Error, etc) for our contests.</p>
</div>

<div class="teamContest">
	<h3>Two Team Contests (24%)</h3>
	<p>1 Midterm Team Contest (10%+0.5%=10.5%, 10 "original" problems, worth 1.0% each).<br>
	1 Final Team Contest (13%+0.5%=13.5%, 10 "original" problems, worth 1.3% each).<br>
	Bonus 0.5% for top 3 teams in both team contests.<br>
	Team size is three students.<br>
	If the class size is not divisible by 3, the last team can have 4 or 5 members.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="homework">
	<h3>Weekly Homework (15%)</h3>
	<p>10 Weekly Homework (10 weeks * 1.5%/week = 15%). <br>
	CP3.17 book review + solve certain written exercises + update the lecturer, 1.5%.<br>
	Scoring scheme: 0% = no submission, 0.5% = poor, 1% = default score, 1.5% superb.</p>

<div class="problemB">
	<h3>Problem Bs (9%)</h3>
	<p class="problemB">
	Solve problem B of last week's mini contest at home, on your own pace, by next Wed 04.30pm (closed by the time Wei Liang's consultation hour is over), if you fail to solve it during the live Mini Contest. Simply submit your code to Mooshak, TA will check your last submission @ Mooshak.
	</p>
	<p>Scoring scheme:<br>
	0% = not AC in the actual mini contest and not attempted after one more week.<br>
	1% = managed to solve problem B during mini contest itself or before deadline.<br>
	There is no additional marks for solving problem C at home (for CS3233R students).</p>
